  - `develop`: Integration branch for features.
  - `feature/<feature-name>`: For developing new features (e.g., `feature/billing`).
  - `bugfix/<bug-name>`: For fixing bugs (e.g., `bugfix/login-error`).
- **Pull Requests**: All changes to `develop` and `main` must be made through pull requests.
- **Code Reviews**: At least one team member must review and approve a pull request before it can be merged.
- **GitHub Projects/Issues**: Use GitHub Issues to track tasks and bugs. GitHub Projects can be used to manage the project timeline and progress.
