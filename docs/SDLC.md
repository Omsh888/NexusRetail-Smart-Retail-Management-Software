# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

**Chosen Model:** Iterative Incremental Model  

The Iterative Incremental Model is selected for Nexus Retail as it supports incremental releases, allows early deployment of core modules, facilitates continuous stakeholder feedback, and reduces risk by integrating modules gradually. This model aligns well with the MERN stack and agile practices.

## Justification
- Complex feature set benefits from incremental development.
- Early delivery of core features while adding advanced modules later.
- Continuous stakeholder feedback integration.
- Supports modular MERN stack development.
